                    <h1>Roronoa Zoro</h1>
                    <p>also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is a main combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two swordsmen, one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and is publicly recognized as the right-hand man of his crew's captain Monkey D. Luffy. Formerly a bounty hunter, he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.

                    Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a matrilineal descendant of both the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma. As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one of the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are referred to as the "Monster Trio". His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.
                    In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty hunter, Zoro, alongside his captain are included among the ranks of the "Worst Generation", pirates who simultaneously reached the Sabaody Archipelago with bounties of over Beli100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War, as well as Marshall D. Teach.

                    He gained his first bounty of Beli60,000,000 after the Arabasta Arc. It later increased to Beli120,000,000 after the Enies Lobby incident, then again to Beli320,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli1,111,000,000.</p>
